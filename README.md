# Portland.gov Branding Template
A simple portland.gov HTML branding template for web applications.

**Version:** 1

## How to use
1. [Download a zip file](https://github.com/eGovPDX/portlandor-branding-template/archive/refs/heads/master.zip) with the latest template.
2. Place the image, CSS, and JavaScript files in the appropriate locations of your application's file structure.
3. `index.html` contains the HTML template code you will need to integrate into your web application. There are comments in the file with a **TODO:** prefix that indicate editable sections or placeholders where your application can insert dynamic HTML content.
4. Don't forget to update the HTML paths to reflect where you placed the files in step 2.

## Updates
We will update the template whenever we make significant changes to the portland.gov branding. Please check back occasionally and update your application when new template versions are released.
